### To open door

Press the Open (upper) button once to engage motor. This should be set for ‘impulse’ operation by the installer, so will self-hold until it stops at the programmed top limit. The movement of the door can be stopped at any time by pressing the Stop button (centre) once.

### To close door

Press and hold the Close (lower) button to engage the motor. This should be set for ‘hold to run’ operation by the installer if there are no safety edges/beams fitted – otherwise it may be set for ‘impulse’ self-hold to close. The motor will stop when the programmed bottom limit has been reached. The movement of the door can be stopped at any time by releasing the Close button.

## Power Failure Operation

GfA motors have a hand chain manual override mechanism.

- Pull the Red toggle to disengage electric drive from the motor and hand haul the chain to operate the door in the appropriate direction.
- Take care not to cause the door to over travel in either direction as this could cause damage.
- To re-engage the electric drive, pull the Green toggle.
- The hand chain should be re-secured in its keep.

::: warning
The manual override system is only designed for emergency use and not daily usage. Premature wear and failure will occur otherwise.
