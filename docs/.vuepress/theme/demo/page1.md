## Important Information

The installer does not assume responsibility for any accidents, injury or damage, which may occur due to user negligence or failure to comply with these instructions.

Rectification work must only be carried out by a suitably qualified door engineer. Any alterations to the operating characteristics or the door itself should only be carried out after consultation with the manufacturer.

This manual contains information to comply with the European Union Machinery Directive, which has been implemented in the UK and covered under the following statutes;

- S.1.1992 No 3073 The Supply of Machinery (Safety) Regulations 1992 and subsequent amendments
- S.1.1994 No 2063 The Supply of Machinery (Safety) (Amendment) Regulations 1994 and subsequent amendments

The legislation requires that all power operated doors comply with the essential safety requirements of the aforementioned regulations and that the manufacturer of the door is required to CE mark its product and issue a Declaration of Conformity for each door supplied.
This manual incorporates our declaration that your door conforms to the above European Directive.

It is imperative that this door, like all machinery, receives adequate maintenance carried out by competent and qualified personnel. This is to enable you to meet your responsibilities under the Provision and Use of Equipment Regulations (1993), to maintain the door and to maximise its service life and minimise repair costs.

## Legal Maintenance Responsibilities

::: warning
Under the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992, anyone in control of a workplace is required to ensure that doors are safe (see regulation 18) and are maintained in a safe condition (see regulation 5).
:::

Under section 3 of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, all businesses have a general duty of care to anyone who might be affected by their activities but is not their employee. Among the consequences of this are;

- A managing agent or a landlord must ensure that doors under their control are safe, even if they are not in a workplace.
- A contractor installing, maintaining or repairing any door must ensure that they always leave it in a safe condition, whoever owns it or whatever it is used for.

Where access to safety critical elements of a door due to boxing in or lack of safe access to areas above ceilings cannot be achieved, the safety of the door cannot be assured and hence cannot be known if the door is safe to use or not. The head-gear of a door often contains many of the safety critical elements;

- Fixings and attachments, bearings, key steels, steel wire ropes, springs, barrel retention elements, door curtain attachments, safety brakes, drive chains and belts, electrical wiring.

All elements of a door need regular inspection, adjustment or lubrication to ensure its ongoing safety.

The most frequent cause of failure, injury and numerous deaths has involved some problem with the safety and security of the head-gear of the door. It is for this reason that access to the head-gear is crucial for maintenance. If the head-gear of a door cannot be accessed, it cannot be maintained in a safe condition. The legal responsibilities of neither the owner nor the maintainer can be satisfied.

Where door head-gear is not accessible for maintenance;

- The owner should be informed that the safety of the door cannot be assessed and that it is not known if it is safe to use or not.
- Hazards may exist when operating or simply passing beneath the door.
- Steps must be taken by the owner to make regular safe access to the head-gear possible.
- Use or passage under the door should be prevented or otherwise protected.

Repairing or otherwise working on the door could be in breach of health and safety law and, in the event of an incident, the owner and the maintainer could both face criminal proceedings. There is also the possibility of civil proceedings for negligence affecting either party.

Any attempt to transfer the legal responsibilities of maintainers/repairers to the owner via a disclaimer document is liable to fail as transferring a criminal responsibility via a civil contract is not possible under UK law.

## Door Warranty

Your roller shutter and associated equipment is guaranteed against faulty materials or manufacturing defects for a period of 12 months from the date of installation, or in the case of ‘supply only’ from date of delivery. The warranty is subject to fair use and the door having been installed, maintained and operated in conformance to this instruction manual.

## General Safety Instructions

::: tip
A roller shutter is a large piece of moving machinery and should be treated with respect. All users of the door need to be trained in its operation - just like any other piece of industrial machinery. Adherence to the instructions will ensure the safe and reliable operation of the roller shutter door.
:::

The following safety instructions must be complied with;

- Keep openings clear at all times.
- Operate the door whilst watching its movement.
- Do not operate a damaged door, or one which appears to have difficulty operating. If this is the case; isolate the power, lock off the door, cordon if required, leave a sign and ensure the door is inspected by a qualified person.
- Do not lean ladders or any other objects against the door, guide channels or shutter housing.
- Stand well clear of the opening whilst the door is being operated.
- Operate the door only by the means originally installed.
- Do not perform any kind of maintenance without first isolating the power and locking off the door to prevent inadvertent operation.
- Do not use the door to lift anything other than itself.
- Do not rush through a moving door.
- Always allow door to open fully before driving a vehicle through.
  Daily User Maintenance Information
  On a daily basis, the user needs to ensure the following;
   There is no damage to any parts of the door.
   Excessive force is not required to operate the door.
   Any damage to the door or excessive force needed to operate the door is reported and action taken as necessary to put the door in good working order.
   The door operation continues to comply with the safety requirements.
   The door remains free from dust and dirt build up which could affect the operation of the door.
   Checks should be made after extreme weather conditions as to the integrity of the door.
